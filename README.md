This is a very simple, yet somewhat well-equipped tool for backing up the user's home dir into /BACKUP_TARS/ which it makes itself.

#FIRST RUN
always do first run as sudo
optional afterward, but if you run into issues, try sudo first

the tar archive is tar -cf nothing fancy at all. 

the script also allows for chown-management in the /BACKUP_TARS/ folder. 
chown/chmod are also required for the tar backup.

#perms perms perms

good luck. pm if you have issues/questions
